<h1>Recommendation Letters</h1>
</div>
<p>Before asking for a recommendation letter, please consider the following advice.</p>
<p>It is usually best to get a recommendation letter from a professor who has taught you more than one course, or taught you a course that involves a project where the professor was able to observe you thinking creatively and working in a team.
Such a professor would have more things to say about you which would ultimately make the recommendation letter they write stronger.
If you have only taken a single course with me and that course does not have a creative and/or team-based component, I will only be able to provide a generic letter.
You should have received at least a B+ in the course(s) that you took with me for me to provide you a letter.</p>
<p>Having considered the above, if you would like to ask for a recommendation letter, please send me your request by email at least three weeks before the deadline and include the term &ldquo;Recommendation Letter&rdquo; in the title.
Please specify in your email what courses you have taken with me and in what semesters, and attach your CV, your unofficial transcripts, a description/link to the program you are applying for, and the deadline for submitting the letter.</p>
